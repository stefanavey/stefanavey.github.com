I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Interdepartmental Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale where I work on mining biological data to understand the immune response to influenza infection and vaccination. My research focuses on developing methods and tools to facilitate the discovery of predictive immune signatures. More generally, I am excited by problems in data science and visualization as well as effective pedagogical practices.

I started this blog to write about interesting projects I've worked on and findings that I hope will help others.
