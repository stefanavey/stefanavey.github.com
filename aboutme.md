---


I was born in Ontario, Canada and raised in Southwest Florida.  I attended undergrad at _The Florida State University (FSU)_ where I started in Biology and moved to the more mathematical and computational side of Biology called [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). I also met my lovely wife while studying at FSU.

I completed my PhD in the [Interdepartmental Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://cbb.yale.edu/) at Yale University. My research focused on mining biological data to understand the immune response to influenza infection and vaccination. I developed and applied machine learning methods and software to facilitate the discovery of predictive immune signatures.

My background in biomedical knowledge and computational methods combined with my scientific training led me to where I currently work at the [Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson](http://www.janssen.com/).
