{% include JB/setup %}

I am a PhD Student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.  I plan to write about things that I encounter during my research that I find interesting and that I think others could benefit from.

I plan to include topics specific to R and Emacs as well as posts of general Bioinformatics interest.
