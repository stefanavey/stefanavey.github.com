# Data Science

### R Shiny Apps

- [**JetBlue Flight Dashboard**](https://sparsedata.shinyapps.io/jb-flight-deals/) - an app that came out of Yale's Hackathon in 2015.  I built this with my friend, [Rob Amezquita](http://robertamezquita.github.io/), and we won JetBlue's honorable mention prize: a roundtrip JetBlue ticket to any destination! Code [on Github](https://github.com/sparsedata/jb-flight-deals).

- [**Clustering Dashboard**](https://sparsedata.shinyapps.io/SparseData-Cluster/) - an app to perform hierarchical clustering (aka segmentation) on user-uploaded data. I created this for a colleague who wanted to perform a clustering analysis without writing any code. I gave some more details on how I built it in this [blog post](r/2015/05/16/A-Shiny-App-To-Interactively-Cluster-Your-Data). Code [on Github](https://github.com/sparsedata/cluster-analysis).


### Teaching

I'm passionate about data science education and have worked on multiple projects to share knowledge in and outside of Yale.

- [**Interactive Data Fluency Tutorial**](https://avey.shinyapps.io/yale-oei) - a tutorial on basic data literacy including data organization, visualization, clustering, and classiciation. [Rob Amezquita](http://robertamezquita.github.io/) and I won an Online Education Innovation grant from the [Yale Center for Teaching and Learning](http://ctl.yale.edu/) to build this project.

- [**Course: Intro to R for Bioinformaticians**](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cbb-jamboree-intro-to-r) - an open-source course hosted on the DataCamp platform. I used these exercises when I taught a workshop on R for Yale Graduate Students. This was part of a larger project I organized called the [CBB Jamboree](tinyurl.com/cbb-jamboree) which allowed upper-year graduate students to lead workshops on _What they wish they had known when entering graduate school_. Code [on Github](https://github.com/stefanavey/cbb-jamboree-intro-to-r).
