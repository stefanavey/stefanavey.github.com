# Motivation

As a Catholic, I've often wondered how much of the Bible is included in the Lectionary for Mass (the readings read during a Catholic service). I found that a Jesuit priest named Felix Just, S.J., Ph.D. had compiled a [website with statistics](http://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/Statistics.htm) on many aspects of the Lectionary including an answer to this very question. 

His analysis shows that a Catholic who attends Mass on Sundays and Feasts (but not weekdays) would hear < 4% of the Old Testament (excluding Psalms) and ~ 41% of the New Testament. Being a Data Scientist, I wanted to dig into these numbers more to understand and *visualize* what was included in the Lectionary.
